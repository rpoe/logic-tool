# logic-tool
## Overview
A little command line tool written in java to help handling of logic formulas. 
The current version includes a parser for clause sets, a truth-table generator 
and a Davis-Putnam SAT-Solver.

## Motivation
The development of the tool was inspired by the CS course "Logic and Formal Systems" I am attending as a student at Leibniz University Hannover (LUH).
Homework exercises were a little bit tedious and to build up my java skills I decided to let the computer do the work. Thanks to Prof. Heribert Vollmer (Institut f√ºr Theoretische Informatik) and Prof. Matthias Becker (Human Computer Interaction Group) for the inspiration !

I am sure there are many other and far more powerful tools out there, so if you use this one, just have a look into the source code especially of the DP SAT Solver, and compare it to the Algorithm given in the Script of the course. 
I was in doubt that the algorithm would work, during the implementation I fully understood why it is really working despite of its simplicity !

## Requirements
To use it, you need a computer with java run time and compiler installed (I am using java 1.8 but many older versions should do it, too)

## Building the tool
Change to the top level directory and execute the build.sh script.

## Using the tool
Invoke the tool with

    java logic/Main

You get a prompt of the tools CLI.

The tool understands the following commands:
* def \<identifier> \<formula>   - define a formula and store it as global symbol
  \<formula> is to be given as array of CNF Terms ((a | b ) & c) <=> {{a,b},{c}}
* ls   - list all global symbols 
* tt \<identifier>   - produce a truth table dump of specified formula
* dpsat \<identifier>  - invoke the Davis-Putnam SAT Solver on the specified formula
* q  - quit the tool

## Usage Example

    Welcome to LOGIC ! (Version 0.0.1)
    > ls
    total 0 symbols
    > def phi {{q4,~q2},{~q4,q1},{q3,q2},{~q4,~q1},{~q3,q2}}
    > ls
    phi={{q4,~q2},{~q4,q1},{q3,q2},{~q4,~q1},{~q3,q2}}
    total 1 symbols
    > tt phi
        q4     q2     q1     q3 result
